    <h1><span id="agent-name"></span>, Welcome to Elite Empire’s Social Media Setup</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      I'm Coach Barbee, and I want to personally welcome you to the Elite Empire brand setup experience. I understand how important social media influence is in today’s world — but I also know how overwhelming it can be to figure it out on your own. That’s why I’ve simplified this process for you.<br><br>
      You don’t have to guess what to post, how to stay compliant, or how to look professional — we’re handling that for you. Our goal is to help you increase your impact and income while decreasing confusion and wasted time. This setup takes less than 20 minutes and can be completed entirely from your phone.<br><br>
      In 2025, social media is not optional—it's a business growth accelerator. Brands that actively post and stay top-of-mind convert 78% more leads and referrals than those that don’t. Most agents using this system generate 3 recruits × $5K/month in premium, attract referrals for Life, Auto, Home, PLPP, Vivint Home Security, Identity Theft Protection, Mortgage Loans, and Investments. With consistency and focus, many agents are earning an additional $1K–$3K monthly—or even building a 6-figure annual income—all on a part-time basis from their phone or home.
